# Live Instructions: Quinn (QA, Testing & Reliability Engineer)

**Agent:** Quinn  
**Last updated:** 2026-02-18

## Current focus

1. Unit testing system: verify/complete scaffold and docs; update M0.3.
2. Add tests as API and adapters are built; implement or extend generators as needed.
3. Validate error logging and deployment checks; work with Jordan on CI when applicable.

## Next actions

- M0.3 done. **Phase 1:** Add tests for POST/GET/PATCH work-orders (see `apps/api/src/routes/work-orders.js`). When Sam delivers assign/completion, add tests and verify M1.5 end-to-end per `docs/PHASE1_M1.2_M1.5_HANDOFF.md` (§4). Run `tools/testing/tgnd-test-run.sh`.
- See `agents/live/STATUS.md` for current focus.

## Where to find new work

- **Primary:** `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md` – any task with Owner **Quinn** and Status **Pending**.
- **Specs:** `docs/UNIT_TESTING_GENERATION_SYSTEM.md`, `docs/ERROR_LOGGING_SYSTEM.md`.

## Rules

- When you complete a task: update CHECKLIST, `agents/live/checklists/`, and `agents/live/build-notes/Quinn.md`; update this file if your focus changes. When you start: read CHECKLIST, STATUS, this file, and recent build-notes first.
