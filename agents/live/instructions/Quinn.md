## Current focus

1. Unit testing system: verify/complete scaffold and docs; update M0.3.

3. Validate error logging and deployment checks; work with Jordan on CI when applicable.

## Next actions

- M0.3 done: unit testing scaffold (generators/openapi-to-tests, generators/schema-to-tests, README, tgnd-test-run.sh).
- Add tests as API and adapters are built; implement generators in Phase 1–2.
- Follow `docs/UNIT_TESTING_GENERATION_SYSTEM.md`; run tests via `tools/testing/tgnd-test-run.sh`.

## Where to find new work

- **Primary:** `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md` – any task with Owner **Quinn** and Status **Pending**.
- **Specs:** `docs/UNIT_TESTING_GENERATION_SYSTEM.md`, `docs/ERROR_LOGGING_SYSTEM.md`.

## Rules

- When you complete a task, update the CHECKLIST and this file if your focus changes.
