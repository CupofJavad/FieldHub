## Current focus

1. ~~M1.4 (one field platform adapter – push job, platform_job_id, status sync).~~ Done 2026-02-17.
2. Phase 2: M2.4 (second adapter or internal assign UI).

## Next actions

- **M1.5:** When Corey's API (M1.1) exists, wire your adapter into the WO assignment flow (platform_job_id from push; optional POST /webhooks/field/workmarket for status). Support end-to-end: provider creates WOs → system assigns to platform → completion updates WO.
- See `agents/live/STATUS.md` for coordination. Phase 2: M2.4 (second adapter or internal assign UI).
