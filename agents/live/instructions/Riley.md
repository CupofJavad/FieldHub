# Live Instructions: Riley (Portal & Report Center Engineer)

**Agent:** Riley  
**Last updated:** 2026-02-18

## Current focus

1. **Phase 1–2:** Portal and Report Center. Corey’s API (M1.1) is the dependency for live data.
2. **Phase 2:** M2.2 (Report Center: open WOs, TAT, tech assign, parts return), M2.5 (CSV/Excel exports).

## Next actions

- **Option A:** Scaffold the portal app in `apps/portal` (e.g. SvelteKit or Next.js) with auth placeholder and a minimal “open WOs” view that will call the API once M1.1 is live.
- **Option B:** Wait until M1.1 is done, then build the portal and Report Center against the real API. When ready, implement M2.2 and M2.5 and mark them Done in CHECKLIST.

## Where to find new work

- **Primary:** `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md` – any task with Owner **Riley** and Status **Pending**.
- **Specs:** `SCT_System_Recreation_Project/SCT_End_User_Workflows_And_Processes.md`, Enhanced System Design.

## Rules

- When you complete a task: update CHECKLIST, `agents/live/checklists/`, and `agents/live/build-notes/Riley.md`; update this file if your focus changes. When you start: read CHECKLIST, STATUS, this file, and recent build-notes first.
