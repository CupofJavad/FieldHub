---

## Current focus

1. Phase 3: M3.1 done (routing/assignment in `packages/ai`). Next: M3.2 (scheduling, anomaly), M3.3 (document extraction), M3.4 (conversational dispatch), M3.5 (AI-led agents integration).

## Next actions

- Take next Pending Morgan task from CHECKLIST (M3.2 when ready).
- Update CHECKLIST for each M3.x when done.

## Where to find new work

- **Primary:** `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md` – any task with Owner **Morgan** and Status **Pending**.
- **Specs:** `SCT_System_Recreation_Project/SCT_Enhanced_System_Design_And_Build_Scope.md` (AI), `SCT_AI_and_Human_Operating_Model.md`.

## Rules

- When you complete a task: update CHECKLIST, `agents/live/checklists/`, and `agents/live/build-notes/Morgan.md`; update this file if your focus changes. When you start: read CHECKLIST, STATUS, this file, and recent build-notes first.
