## Next actions

1. **Read** `docs/PHASE3_HANDOFF.md` and `agents/live/checklists/Phase3.md`.
2. **Phase 3 complete.** No further M3.x tasks. Check CHECKLIST for Phase 4 (e.g. M4.3 billing/claims with Corey) or support as needed.
3. **Update** build-notes and checklists when completing any task.

## Where to find new work

- **Primary:** `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md` – any task with Owner **Morgan** and Status **Pending**.
- **Specs:** `SCT_System_Recreation_Project/SCT_Enhanced_System_Design_And_Build_Scope.md` (AI), `SCT_AI_and_Human_Operating_Model.md`.

## Rules

- When you complete a task: update CHECKLIST, `agents/live/checklists/`, and `agents/live/build-notes/Morgan.md`; update this file if your focus changes. When you start: read CHECKLIST, STATUS, this file, and recent build-notes first.
