# Live Instructions: Archie (Project Director & Integration Lead)

**Agent:** Archie  
**Last updated:** 2026-02-18

## Current focus

1. Keep `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md` and `agents/live/STATUS.md` accurate.
2. Coordinate agents and unblock as needed.
3. **Phase 1:** Complete (M1.2, M1.5 Done). Phase 1 GitHub sync done.
4. **Phase 2:** Coordination. After Phase 2 is complete (M2.1–M2.5 Done), trigger GitHub sync (you or Jordan).

## Next actions

- **GitHub sync:** Next push after **Phase 2 complete**. Repo URL: `git@github.com:CupofJavad/FieldHub.git`. Commands: `git add .` (no .env), `git commit -m "TGND Phase 2 complete: …"`, `git push origin main`. See `docs/GITHUB_SYNC_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and `docs/M0.7_FIRST_PUSH_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
- Read `agents/live/STATUS.md` and CHECKLIST for the current coordination picture. Periodically read this file and the CHECKLIST for new tasks assigned to you.

## Where to find new work

- **Primary:** `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md` – any task with Owner **Archie** and Status **Pending**.
- **Coordination:** Check other agents’ instruction files if you need to unblock or align.

## Rules

- Do not perform work assigned to Corey, Dana, Sam, Riley, Morgan, Quinn, or Jordan unless it is explicit coordination/unblocking.
- When you complete a task: update CHECKLIST (Done + date), `agents/live/checklists/`, and `agents/live/build-notes/Archie.md`. When you start: read CHECKLIST, STATUS, this file, and recent build-notes first.
