# Live Instructions: Archie (Project Director & Integration Lead)

**Agent:** Archie  
**Last updated:** 2026-02-18

## Current focus

1. Keep `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md` accurate.
2. Coordinate agents and unblock as needed.
3. **M0.7:** Ensure the first GitHub push is completed (by you or Jordan). Repo is initialized and committed; only remote add + push remains. See `docs/M0.7_FIRST_PUSH_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
4. After M0.7 is Done, Phase 0 is complete; then Phase 1 is active (Corey M1.1/M1.3, Dana M1.2, Sam M1.5).

## Next actions

- Coordinate with Jordan to complete M0.7 (add remote, push). If you have GitHub access, you may do the push yourself.
- Update CHECKLIST: set M0.7 to Done when the push succeeds.
- Read `agents/live/STATUS.md` for the current coordination picture. Periodically read this file and the CHECKLIST for new tasks assigned to you.

## Where to find new work

- **Primary:** `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md` – any task with Owner **Archie** and Status **Pending**.
- **Coordination:** Check other agents’ instruction files if you need to unblock or align.

## Rules

- Do not perform work assigned to Corey, Dana, Sam, Riley, Morgan, Quinn, or Jordan unless it is explicit coordination/unblocking.
- When you complete a task, update the CHECKLIST (set Status to Done and date).
