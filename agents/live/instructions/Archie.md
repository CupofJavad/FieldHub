# Live Instructions: Archie (Project Director & Integration Lead)

**Agent:** Archie  
**Last updated:** 2026-02-18

## Current focus

1. Keep `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md` and `agents/live/STATUS.md` accurate.
2. Coordinate agents and unblock as needed.
3. **Phase 1–3:** Complete; sync done.
4. **Phase 4:** Keep STATUS and CHECKLIST accurate. Trigger **Phase 4 GitHub sync** when M4.1–M4.5 Done (you or Jordan).

## Next actions

- **Phase 3:** Ensure STATUS “Immediate next actions” points Morgan at M3.2 → M3.4 → M3.5. See `docs/PHASE3_HANDOFF.md` and `agents/live/checklists/Phase3.md`. Phase 3 sync done. Next: Phase 4 sync when complete. Repo: `git@github.com:CupofJavad/FieldHub.git`. See `docs/GITHUB_SYNC_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
- Read CHECKLIST and STATUS each run; update coordination and build-notes as needed.

## Where to find new work

- **Primary:** `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md` – any task with Owner **Archie** and Status **Pending**.
- **Coordination:** Check other agents’ instruction files if you need to unblock or align.

## Rules

- Do not perform work assigned to Corey, Dana, Sam, Riley, Morgan, Quinn, or Jordan unless it is explicit coordination/unblocking.
- When you complete a task: update CHECKLIST (Done + date), `agents/live/checklists/`, and `agents/live/build-notes/Archie.md`. When you start: read CHECKLIST, STATUS, this file, and recent build-notes first.
