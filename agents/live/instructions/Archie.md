# Live Instructions: Archie (Project Director & Integration Lead)

**Agent:** Archie  
**Last updated:** 2026-02-17

---

## Current focus

1. Keep `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md` accurate.
2. Coordinate agents and unblock as needed.
3. Trigger or perform GitHub sync at milestone boundaries (after Phase 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and at completion).

## Next actions

- Complete your initial tasks (confirm structure, agent system, coordinate with Jordan on M0.6/M0.7).
- After Phase 0 is done, ensure the first GitHub push is executed (by you or Jordan).
- Periodically read this file and the CHECKLIST for new tasks assigned to you.

## Where to find new work

- **Primary:** `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md` – any task with Owner **Archie** and Status **Pending**.
- **Coordination:** Check other agents’ instruction files if you need to unblock or align.

## Rules

- Do not perform work assigned to Corey, Dana, Sam, Riley, Morgan, Quinn, or Jordan unless it is explicit coordination/unblocking.
- When you complete a task, update the CHECKLIST (set Status to Done and date).
