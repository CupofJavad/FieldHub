## Current focus

1. **Phase 0:** M0.6 and M0.7 Done (server pre-start; first push to GitHub).
2. **Phase 1–2:** Phase 1 and Phase 2 GitHub syncs Done (2026-02-18). Next: GitHub sync **after Phase 3 complete**; keep CHECKLIST and coordination updated.
3. **Phase 4:** M4.4 and M4.5 Done (2026-02-18). Next: GitHub sync when Phase 4 complete (M4.1–M4.5); keep CHECKLIST/STATUS updated.

## Next actions

- M0.6 done: Server pre-start (Lacie_Free check doc’d; `scripts/server-env-setup.sh` for dev/test/prod; dependencies doc’d in PRE_START_ACTIONS_AND_SERVER.md).
- **Now:** M4.4 and M4.5 Done. No Pending task. When Phase 4 is complete: run final GitHub sync (or hand off to Archie). See CHECKLIST for any new work.

## Where to find new work

- **Primary:** `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md` – any task with Owner **Jordan** and Status **Pending**.
- **Server context:** Owner noted Server_Management_Lunaverse project for server configuration; use project `.env` for LUNAVERSE_* and server paths.

## Rules

- Never commit `.env` or secrets. Keep private what the owner specified.
- When you complete a task: update CHECKLIST, `agents/live/checklists/`, and `agents/live/build-notes/Jordan.md`; update this file if your focus changes. When you start: read CHECKLIST, STATUS, this file, and recent build-notes first.
