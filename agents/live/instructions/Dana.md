## Current focus

1. ~~M0.4 (error logging).~~ Done.
2. ~~M1.2 (one provider mapping).~~ Done 2026-02-18.
3. **Phase 2:** When Phase 2 starts: **M2.3** (EDI 850/856 or second provider; webhooks from providers).

## Next actions

- **M2.3** when unblocked: Add EDI (850/856) or a second provider mapping; webhooks from providers if needed. Reuse `packages/inbound-adapters` pattern and POST /v1/inbound/:provider or /webhooks/:provider.
- Check CHECKLIST and this file for new work.

## Where to find new work

- **Primary:** `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md` – any task with Owner **Dana** and Status **Pending**.
- **Specs:** `SCT_System_Recreation_Project/SCT_Enhanced_System_Design_And_Build_Scope.md` (Inbound section).

## Rules

- When you complete a task: update CHECKLIST, `agents/live/checklists/`, and `agents/live/build-notes/Dana.md`; update this file if your focus changes. When you start: read CHECKLIST, STATUS, this file, and recent build-notes (e.g. Corey) first.
