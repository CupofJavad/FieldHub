## Current focus

1. ~~M0.4 (error logging).~~ Done.
2. **Phase 1:** Implement **M1.2** (one provider mapping – mock or real OEM/CSV/API).

## Next actions

- **Start M1.2:** Implement at least one provider mapping that creates work orders (e.g. mock OEM or a real CSV/API). Map provider payload to the canonical WO model. Use `packages/logger` in your code. Integrate with Corey’s API (M1.1) when it is ready.
- Mark M1.2 Done in CHECKLIST when one provider can create/update WOs. Next up for you: M2.3 (EDI or second provider; webhooks) in Phase 2.
