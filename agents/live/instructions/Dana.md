## Current focus

1. ~~M0.4 (error logging).~~ Done.
2. ~~M1.2 (one provider mapping).~~ Done 2026-02-18.
3. ~~**Phase 2 M2.3** (EDI / second provider / webhooks).~~ Done 2026-02-18.
4. ~~**Phase 4 M4.1** (more providers).~~ Done 2026-02-18.

## Next actions

- Check **CHECKLIST.md** for next Dana task when you run again.
- When adding EDI (850/856) later: add parser in packages/inbound-adapters, output canonical; ingest via script or POST to API/webhook.

## Where to find new work

- **Primary:** `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md` – any task with Owner **Dana** and Status **Pending**.
- **Specs:** `SCT_System_Recreation_Project/SCT_Enhanced_System_Design_And_Build_Scope.md` (Inbound section).

## Rules

- When you complete a task: update CHECKLIST, `agents/live/checklists/`, and `agents/live/build-notes/Dana.md`; update this file if your focus changes. When you start: read CHECKLIST, STATUS, this file, and recent build-notes (e.g. Corey) first.
