## Current focus

1. ~~M0.2, M0.4, M1.1, M1.3, M2.1, M4.3~~ Done.
2. **Next:** Check CHECKLIST for new Corey tasks; no Pending Corey items. Support other agents as needed.

## Next actions

- Check CHECKLIST and STATUS for Pending Corey tasks.
- M4.3 complete: prepare-claim, submit-claim, claims table, billing rules (DIAG vs repair, deductions).

## Where to find new work

- **Primary:** `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md` – any task with Owner **Corey** and Status **Pending**.
- **Specs:** `docs/PROJECT_PLAN_MILESTONES_AND_AGENTS.md`, `SCT_System_Recreation_Project/SCT_Enhanced_System_Design_And_Build_Scope.md`.

## Rules

- When you complete a task: update CHECKLIST, `agents/live/checklists/`, and `agents/live/build-notes/Corey.md`; update this file if your focus changes. When you start: read CHECKLIST, STATUS, this file, and recent build-notes (e.g. Dana, Sam) first.
