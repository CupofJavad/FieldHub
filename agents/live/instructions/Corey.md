**Agent:** Corey  
**Last updated:** 2026-02-18

## Current focus

1. ~~M0.2, M0.4, M1.1, M1.3~~ Done.
2. **Next:** M2.1 (service-type engine; completion validation) when Phase 2 starts; support M1.5 and Dana/Sam as needed.

## Next actions

- Check CHECKLIST for new Corey tasks. Support M1.5 (end-to-end flow) if Sam/Dana need API tweaks.
- When Phase 2 starts: M2.1 – service-type engine (OSR, OSS, installation, etc.), completion validation.

## Where to find new work

- **Primary:** `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md` – any task with Owner **Corey** and Status **Pending**.
- **Specs:** `docs/PROJECT_PLAN_MILESTONES_AND_AGENTS.md`, `SCT_System_Recreation_Project/SCT_Enhanced_System_Design_And_Build_Scope.md`.

## Rules

- When you complete a task: update CHECKLIST, `agents/live/checklists/`, and `agents/live/build-notes/Corey.md`; update this file if your focus changes. When you start: read CHECKLIST, STATUS, this file, and recent build-notes (e.g. Dana, Sam) first.
