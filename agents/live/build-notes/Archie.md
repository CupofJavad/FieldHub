## 2026-02-18 – Phase 1 complete; STATUS/CHECKLIST + instruction update

- **Assignment:** After M1.2 and M1.5 Done, ensure STATUS and CHECKLIST reflect Phase 1 complete, run Phase 1 GitHub sync, test, log, update tracking.
- **Done:** CHECKLIST “Current focus” and “Last updated” set to Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 active. STATUS “Current phase” set to Phase 1 complete / Phase 2 active; “Immediate next actions” table updated for all agents (Corey M2.1, Dana M2.3, Sam M2.4, Riley M2.2/M2.5, Quinn Phase 1 E2E verified, Archie/Jordan next sync after Phase 2). Dependency order section updated to Phase 2.
- **Sync:** Phase 1 sync was already committed and pushed (commit “TGND Phase 1 complete: M1.1–M1.5…”). Verified branch up to date with `origin/main`; no .env or secrets committed.
- **Tracking:** Updated `agents/live/instructions/Archie.md`: current focus now Phase 2 coordination; next GitHub sync after Phase 2 complete; repo URL and push process retained for reference.
- **Issues:** None. Quinn row in STATUS had a curly apostrophe in “Sam’s”; replaced via sed to avoid encoding mismatch.
- **Next:** Archie has no Pending checklist tasks. Next work: keep CHECKLIST/STATUS accurate; trigger GitHub sync when Phase 2 complete. Read CHECKLIST and STATUS when running again.
