## 2026-02-18 – Phase 1 GitHub sync

- **Assignment:** After M1.2 and M1.5 Done, run Phase 1 GitHub sync and update coordination.
- **Done:** CHECKLIST already showed Phase 1 complete (M1.2, M1.5 Done). Confirmed STATUS.md reflected Phase 1 complete and Phase 2 active; table already had Phase 2 next actions for most agents.
- **Git:** Staged all changes (verified .env not staged, .gitignore in place). Committed as `bf2091c`: "TGND Phase 1 complete: M1.1–M1.5 (API, DB, provider mapping, assign/completion); agent checklists, build-notes, Phase 2 STATUS". Pushed to `origin main` (git@github.com:CupofJavad/FieldHub.git). Push succeeded.
- **No issues.** Next: GitHub sync after Phase 2 complete; Jordan’s next Pending tasks are M4.4, M4.5 (Phase 4).
