# TGND Live Status – Coordination for All Agents

**Last updated:** 2026-02-18 (Archie: Phase 4 complete; final sync)

---

## Agent session rules (read every time you run)

1. **Start of session:** Read `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md`, `agents/live/STATUS.md`, `agents/live/instructions/<YOUR_NAME>.md`, and recent `agents/live/build-notes/*.md` from agents you depend on. Then set up your environment for your next tasks and take the next Pending task or anticipate work.
2. **When you complete work:** Update (1) `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md` (mark Done + date), (2) `agents/live/checklists/` (detailed subtasks), (3) `agents/live/build-notes/<YOUR_NAME>.md` (what you did, decisions, handoffs). See `agents/live/checklists/README.md` and `agents/live/build-notes/README.md`.
3. **Stay busy:** If no Pending task, set up env for your next milestone, add/refine detailed checklists, read others’ build-notes and anticipate handoffs, run tests/lint. See `docs/AGENT_SYSTEM_AND_AUTONOMY.md` (§4–5).
