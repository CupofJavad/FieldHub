# M0.7 – First Push to GitHub (Complete Phase 0)

**Status:** Repo is initialized with `main` branch and initial commit. `.env` is in `.gitignore` and is **not** committed.

**Who completes M0.7:** Jordan or Archie (whoever has GitHub remote and credentials).

---

## Steps to complete M0.7

1. **Add your GitHub remote** (replace with your actual repo URL):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/Javad/TGND_System
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_ORG_OR_USER/TGND_System.git
   ```
   Or with SSH:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_ORG_OR_USER/TGND_System.git
   ```

2. **Push (HTTPS with token):**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   If prompted for password, use your GitHub personal access token (from project `.env` as `GITHUB_TOKEN` – do not paste it here; use it locally only).

3. **Mark M0.7 Done** in `agents/live/CHECKLIST.md`: set status to `☑ Done` and add today’s date.

4. **Update** `agents/live/instructions/Jordan.md` and `agents/live/instructions/Archie.md` to reflect that Phase 0 is complete and Phase 1 is active.

After M0.7 is done, **Phase 0 is complete**. Proceed to Phase 1 per the checklist (Corey: M1.1, M1.3; Dana: M1.2; then M1.5).
