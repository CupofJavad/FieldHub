# Schema → Unit Tests Generator

**Purpose:** Generate model validation and fixture tests from the canonical WO (and related) schema (TypeScript/JSON).

**Status:** Scaffold. Implement in Phase 1–2 (see `docs/UNIT_TESTING_GENERATION_SYSTEM.md`).

**Usage (when implemented):**

```bash
node tools/testing/generators/schema-to-tests/index.js
```

**Output:** Property and validation tests for canonical model (work order, provider, service type).
